create a Slack bot that can receive commands from users and respond to them. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Import necessary packages: The code imports the required packages, including "context," "fmt," "log," "os," and "strconv." It also imports the "github.com/shomalli11/slacker" package, which is presumably a Slack bot library.

printCommandEvents function: This function listens for events on the analyticsChannel and prints information about the received command events. It prints details such as the command text, timestamp, parameters, and event type.

main function:

It sets Slack bot tokens using the os.Setenv function. 
It initializes a Slack bot using the "slacker" library by creating a new instance of slacker.Client. The Slack bot is created with the provided tokens.
It launches a goroutine to call the printCommandEvents function and pass the bot's CommandEvents channel to it. This function will print command events as they are received.
It defines a command using the bot.Command method. The command is named "my yob is <year>" and has a description and example provided. When this command is triggered in a Slack channel, it will call the specified handler function.
The handler function is defined within the slacker.CommandDefinition. It extracts the "year" parameter from the request, calculates the user's age, and responds with a message containing the calculated age.
It creates a context and a cancel function for managing the bot's execution. The context is used to control the bot's lifecycle.
It starts the bot by calling bot.Listen(ctx) to listen for and respond to incoming Slack messages. If there's an error, it logs the error and exits.
